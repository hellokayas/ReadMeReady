This technique also allows those small sets of parameters to be added efficiently into the model itself, which means you can do fine-tuning on lots of data sets, potentially, and swap these \"adapters\" into your model when necessary.\n","- [Bits and Bytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes): An excellent package by Tim Dettmers et al., which provides a lightweight wrapper around custom CUDA functions that make LLMs go faster - optimizers, matrix mults, and quantization. In this notebook we'll be using the library to load our model as efficiently as possible.\n","- [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft): An excellent Huggingface library that enables a number Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which again make it less expensive to fine-tune LLMs - especially on more lightweight hardware like that present in Kaggle notebooks.\n","\n","Many thanks to [Bojan Tunguz](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz) for his excellent [Jeopardy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/200000-jeopardy-questions)!\n","\n","This notebook is based on [an excellent example from LangChain](https://github.com/asokraju/LangChainDatasetForge/blob/main/Finetuning_Falcon_7b.ipynb)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wIa8WRIHvuZy"},"source":["## Package Installation\n","\n","Note that we're loading very specific versions of these libraries.
