You can also install ranger through PyPI: `pip install ranger-fm`. However, it is recommended to use [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) instead (to benefit from isolated environments). Use `pipx run --spec ranger-fm ranger` to install and run ranger in one step. <details> <summary> Check current version: <sub> <a href=""https://repology.org/metapackage/ranger/versions""> <img src=""https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/ranger.svg"" alt=""Packaging status""> </a> </sub> </summary> <a href=""https://repology.org/metapackage/ranger/versions""> <img src=""https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/ranger.svg"" alt=""Packaging status""> </a> </details>"
Installing from a clone,"Note that you don't *have* to install ranger; you can simply run `ranger.py`. To install ranger manually: ``` sudo make install ``` This translates roughly to: ``` sudo python setup.py install --optimize=1 --record=install_log.txt ``` This also saves a list of all installed files to `install_log.txt`, which you can use to uninstall ranger. Getting Started --------------- After starting ranger, you can use the Arrow Keys or `h` `j` `k` `l` to navigate, `Enter` to open a file or `q` to quit.  The third column shows a preview of the current file.  The second is the main column and the first shows the parent directory. Ranger can automatically copy default configuration files to `~/.config/ranger` if you run it with the switch `--copy-config=( rc | scope | ... | all )`. See `ranger --help` for a description of that switch.  Also check `ranger/config/` for the default configuration.
