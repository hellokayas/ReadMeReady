,"PTB can be installed with optional dependencies: * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[passport]""`` installs the `cryptography>=39.0.1 <https://cryptography.io/en/stable>`_ library. Use this, if you want to use Telegram Passport related functionality. * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[socks]""`` installs `httpx[socks] <https://www.python-httpx.org/#dependencies>`_. Use this, if you want to work behind a Socks5 server. * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[http2]""`` installs `httpx[http2] <https://www.python-httpx.org/#dependencies>`_. Use this, if you want to use HTTP/2. * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[rate-limiter]""`` installs `aiolimiter~=1.1.0 <https://aiolimiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Use this, if you want to use ``telegram.ext.AIORateLimiter``. * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[webhooks]""`` installs the `tornado~=6.4 <https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`_ library. Use this, if you want to use ``telegram.ext.Updater.start_webhook``/``telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook``. * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[callback-data]""`` installs the `cachetools~=5.3.3 <https://cachetools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library. Use this, if you want to use `arbitrary callback_data <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Arbitrary-callback_data>`_. * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[job-queue]""`` installs the `APScheduler~=3.10.4 <https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/>`_ library and enforces `pytz>=2018.6 <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_, where ``pytz`` is a dependency of ``APScheduler``. Use this, if you want to use the ``telegram.ext.JobQueue``. To install multiple optional dependencies, separate them by commas, e.g. ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[socks,webhooks]""``. Additionally, two shortcuts are provided: * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[all]""`` installs all optional dependencies. * ``pip install ""python-telegram-bot[ext]""`` installs all optional dependencies that are related to ``telegram.ext``, i.e. ``[rate-limiter, webhooks, callback-data, job-queue]``. Quick Start =========== Our Wiki contains an `Introduction to the API <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Introduction-to-the-API>`_ explaining how the pure Bot API can be accessed via ``python-telegram-bot``. Moreover, the `Tutorial: Your first Bot <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Extensions---Your-first-Bot>`_ gives an introduction on how chatbots can be easily programmed with the help of the ``telegram.ext`` module. Resources ========= - The `package documentation <https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/>`_ is the technical reference for ``python-telegram-bot``. It contains descriptions of all available classes, modules, methods and arguments as well as the `changelog <https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/changelog.html>`_. - The `wiki <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/>`_ is home to number of more elaborate introductions of the different features of ``python-telegram-bot`` and other useful resources that go beyond the technical documentation. - Our `examples section <https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/examples.html>`_ contains several examples that showcase the different features of both the Bot API and ``python-telegram-bot``. Even if it is not your approach for learning, please take a look at ``echobot.py``. It is the de facto base for most of the bots out there. The code for these examples is released to the public domain, so you can start by grabbing the code and building on top of it. - The `official Telegram Bot API documentation <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api>`_ is of course always worth a read. Getting help ============ If the resources mentioned above don't answer your questions or simply overwhelm you, there are several ways of getting help. 1. We have a vibrant community of developers helping each other in our `Telegram group <https://telegram.me/pythontelegrambotgroup>`_. Join us! Asking a question here is often the quickest way to get a pointer in the right direction. 2. Ask questions by opening `a discussion <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/discussions/new>`_. 3. You can even ask for help on Stack Overflow using the `python-telegram-bot tag <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-telegram-bot>`_. Concurrency =========== Since v20.0, ``python-telegram-bot`` is built on top of Pythons ``asyncio`` module. Because ``asyncio`` is in general single-threaded, ``python-telegram-bot`` does currently not aim to be thread-safe. Noteworthy parts of ``python-telegram-bots`` API that are likely to cause issues (e.g. race conditions) when used in a multi-threaded setting include: * ``telegram.ext.Application/Updater.update_queue`` * ``telegram.ext.ConversationHandler.check/handle_update`` * ``telegram.ext.CallbackDataCache`` * ``telegram.ext.BasePersistence`` * all classes in the ``telegram.ext.filters`` module that allow to add/remove allowed users/chats at runtime Contributing ============ Contributions of all sizes are welcome. Please review our `contribution guidelines <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ to get started. You can also help by `reporting bugs or feature requests <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/new/choose>`_. Donating ======== Occasionally we are asked if we accept donations to support the development. While we appreciate the thought, maintaining PTB is our hobby, and we have almost no running costs for it. We therefore have nothing set up to accept donations. If you still want to donate, we kindly ask you to donate to another open source project/initiative of your choice instead.

Derivatives works (including modifications or anything statically linked to the library) can only be redistributed under LGPL-3, but applications that use the library don't have to be."
