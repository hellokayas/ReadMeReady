Flexible,"Control timeout, delay, add seeds, exclude URLs matching a regex pattern and other cool stuff. The extensive range of [options](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage) provided by Photon lets you crawl the web exactly the way you want."
Genius,"Photon's smart thread management & refined logic gives you top notch performance. Still, crawling can be resource intensive but Photon has some tricks up it's sleeves. You can fetch URLs archived by [archive.org](https://archive.org/) to be used as seeds by using `--wayback` option."
