Quick Start:,"If you're new to Dagster, we recommend reading about its [core concepts](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts) or learning with the hands-on [tutorial](https://docs.dagster.io/tutorial). Dagster is available on PyPI and officially supports Python 3.8 through Python 3.12. ```bash pip install dagster dagster-webserver ``` This installs two packages: - `dagster`: The core programming model. - `dagster-webserver`: The server that hosts Dagster's web UI for developing and operating Dagster jobs and assets. Running on a Mac with an Apple silicon chip? Check the [install details here](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/install#installing-dagster-into-an-existing-python-environment)."
