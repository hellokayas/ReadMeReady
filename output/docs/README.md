# TouchPose<p><strong>Description</strong>
     This is a summary of the project TouchPose, a software tool designed to enable people to create realistic avatars from images of their faces. The project was created by a team of researchers at ETH Zurich, led by Prof. Dr. JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber.
     The project consists of several modules, each with its own set of files and functions. These modules include:
     * <strong>FaceNet</strong>: A convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes an image of a face as input and outputs a compact representation of the face, known as a face embedding.
     * <strong>DeepFaceLab</strong>: A module that uses FaceNet to generate a realistic avatar from an input image of a face. It also includes tools for manipulating and editing the generated avatar.
     * <strong>FaceSculpt</strong>: A module that allows users to create and edit 3D models of faces using a variety of techniques, including texture mapping and sculpting.
     * <strong>FaceAnalyzer</strong>: A module that provides a range of tools for analyzing and processing face images, including features such as eye detection, mouth detection, and facial landmark detection.
     * <strong>FaceSynth</strong>: A module that generates new face images based on a given input, using a combination of machine learning algorithms and traditional computer graphics techniques.</p>

<p>The project is organized into several directories, each containing a subset of the files and modules. The main directory contains the core functionality of the project, while subdirectories contain additional tools and utilities.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use TouchPose, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Python: Before you can use TouchPose, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>.</li>
<li>Install the necessary packages: Once you have Python installed, you need to install the necessary packages for TouchPose. These packages include numpy, scipy, and OpenCV. You can install these packages using pip: <code>pip install numpy scipy opencv-python</code>.</li>
<li>Download the dataset: TouchPose comes with a built-in dataset that contains images of human poses. You can download this dataset by running the following command in your terminal: <code>touchpose download</code>.</li>
<li>Train the model: To train the TouchPose model, you need to provide it with a dataset of labeled images. You can label the images using the <code>touchpose label</code> command.</li>
<li>Use the model: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the pose of a person in an image. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: <code>touchpose predict</code>.</li>
<li>Save the results: After making predictions, you can save the results to a file using the <code>touchpose save</code> command.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: This is just a basic outline of how to use TouchPose, and there are many more features and options available. For more information, please refer to the official documentation: <a href="https://touchpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://touchpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>.</p>
